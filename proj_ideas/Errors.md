# Based on my research these might be the reasons that we get errors:

### Description:
**1. Incorrect Working Directory:**  
* The ls *.py command is being executed in a directory where there are no Python files. This could be due to an incorrect working directory being set before this command runs.
* Possible Solution: Ensure the command is run in the correct directory. If your Python files are in a specific directory, you might need to change to that directory (cd) before running ls *.py.


**2. Directory Structure in CI/CD Environment:**  
* The directory structure in your CI/CD environment might differ from your local setup. Files that exist locally might not be present or in a different location in the CI/CD environment.
* Possible Solution: Review the CI/CD pipeline configuration to ensure it correctly checks out all necessary files and directories from your repository.


**3. Makefile Configuration:**  
* The make tests target might be configured in a way that assumes a certain directory structure or file presence that doesn't hold true in the CI/CD environment.
* Possible Solution: Review the make tests target in your Makefile. Ensure that it accounts for the actual structure of your project in the CI/CD environment.


**4. Python File Naming or Presence:**  
* There might be an issue with the naming of your Python files or they might not be present due to .gitignore settings or CI/CD configuration steps that exclude them.
* Possible Solution: Check the naming of your Python files and ensure they are not excluded by .gitignore or CI/CD configuration.

**5. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**  
* The error might be due to how your CI/CD pipeline is set up, particularly regarding how it checks out or sets up the project repository.
* Possible Solution: Review the steps in your CI/CD pipeline configuration that set up the repository and working environment. Ensure that all necessary files are checked out and available.
