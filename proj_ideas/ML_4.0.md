# ML

### Description:
We will be adding an AI module to our website/application to be able to identify and pin point the possible bias in news articles found online.

**Doing Research**  
We worked on the idea of how to create our model and which members can help with this Part of the project. Currently 3 members, including Sina, Elijah and Sanjana are mainly working on Our ML model due to their previous experience.

**Gathering Data**  
We have been looking for possible sources to gather data for training our model. This will be included in the files seperately.

**Choosing the Model**  
The concept is that we need to mainly focus on binary classification algorithms to analyze if an article is biased(Democrat or Repoblican). We may also add a logistic regression model to estimate how much biased is the article on a scale of 0-1. For the data, need to process our data and filter it first. If needed we can use feature transformation as well. Then we also need to decide if we want to use SVM or Neural Networks. We will possibly try both to see which one performs better for our purposes.

**Training the Model**  
TBD...
