# ML

### ML Research:
- four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
- supervised learning = taught by example, labeled data
- semi-supervised learning = learns from labeled + unlabeled data
- unsupervised learning = no labels, try to organize/group data based on similarities
- reinforcement learning = algorithm is provided with a set of actions, parameters, and end values; tries to optimize end result



### Explanation:
One of the ways to decide which the bias of different news and articles is to base our approach on the frequencies of the different phrases and. This method also allows us to categorize different articles into different groups in future rather than just using binary classification. One initial problem that we faced with this method was that some wordings had same meanings but different intensities. So we had to add a measurement to specify the intencity(quality) into our taining. One of the suggestions was to categorize each word into three intensity level such as nutral, weak and strong. That way we can associate different weight for those. Another approach can be to come up with some weights by using a potential neural network. We are expecting to make more progress on gathwering data and agreeing on training models the coming week.
