# NLP breakdown
According to this article: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/10/main-approaches-natural-language-processing-tasks.html

NLP approaches = 
* Rule-based (human-defined rules and patterns to look for)
* "Traditional" machine learning approaches (like probabilistic modeling, likelihood maximization, and linear classifiers. Notably, these are not neural network models)
* Neural Networks

NLP task types = 
* Text Classification Tasks (find meaning without caring about word order, to flag topics and characterize text)
* Word Sequence Tasks (goal = language modeling, word order matters)
* Text Meaning Tasks (goal = how do we represent meaning)
* Sequence to Sequence Tasks (e.g. summarization and simplification tasks)
* Dialog Systems
    * Goal-oriented dialog systems focus on being useful in a particular, restricted domain
    * Conversational dialog systems are concerned with being helpful or entertaining in a much more general context

* Sentiment Analysis
* Named Entity Recognition
* Summarization
* Topic Modeling
