## Idea #3: Restaurant Recommendation Tool
### Description:
**Problem:**
When eating out with friends, researching what restaurants you want to eat at can take a lot of time. Finding the top rated 
restaurants in your area, something to fit your price range or budget, figuring out where the deals are, looking at the menus 
to see what restaurants cater to your preferences, etc. Surely there must be an easier way?

**Solution:** 
Based on a person's preferences + mood, automatically recommend some restarants and highlight what might set that restaraunt 
apart for a person in that moment, so that they can quickly + easy "explore" the restaurants in their area!

**Initial target customers:**
New Yorkers and/or NYU students.

**Implementation:**
1. For this idea we need a databases of different restaurants and their cuisines, locations and any relavant data for them including price and opening hours. We can use CRUD operations to update the database, and API endpoints to fetch/write different kinds of data.
2. In addition we can allow users to create profiles to optimize recommendations based on their previous experiences and experiences of other people with same interests and backgrounds. A one time profile setup is easier than researching on google for every restaurant!
3. Also users can rate their experiences that will also be stored in the databases.
4. Coupons and discounts can be also included in the server to be considered.
5. For this project we can also use ML tools to enhance the performance and user experience by using databases from online resources as well. We can potentially scrape data from the web.
6. This project is expandable to a customer base of more than just New York, so it can be scaled up to different regions of different sizes.
7. We can potentially let users create "friend groups" with other users so they can easily see what restaurants they have in common with their friends! This makes group planning much easier.
