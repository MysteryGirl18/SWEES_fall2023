# RoadMap + Structure

### Description:
**Week 2**  
Done: Meeting #1, discussion about potential project ideas, analysimg different ideas.

**Week 3**  
Done: Meeting #2, finalizing the project idea, doing when2meet to schedule meetings, GitHub Action working, planning the roadmap, analysing each members skills and roles, assigning a team leader, identifying resources, problems, requirements and tools.

**Week 4**  
Plan: Specifying snd strating to develop the main modules of the project. Assigning readings, colaboration mechanisms and coding/testing assignments. Breaking down the project into smaller tasks.  
Done: We improved the makefile configuration according to the specified assignment, worked on API and set it up, and also started with the AI model that we want to add to our project.

**Week 5**  
Plan: Start Working on AI model and add more base files.
Done: Held meeting to coordinate subgroups and open new channels of communication through subgroups. Some problems were brought up regarding implemintation and communication and solution was provided by all members. API has been improved. AI subteam has been initiated.

**Week 6**  
Plan:
Done: API functionality was improved. AI sub group started sharing resourses and holding additional meeting to coordinate. A decision was made to progress the AI required for our project based on two different approaches. One to use an LLM structure for training our model and developing it. Second to develop our own algorithm and model based on the approches that we did research on. Some courses and articles were also shared in the related slack subchannel for this purpase. The weekly task was also completed.

**Week 7**  
Plan: Compare two AI approches and ocusing on the one that is more useful for our purpose...
Done: We discussed the progress and problems that occured, such as an error that occured when we were trying to submit a request to create a new user. we improved the test and made more progress on AI model.

**Week 8**  
Plan: we will improve the project based on class and might start with implementing and testing our machine learning model.
