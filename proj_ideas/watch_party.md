## Idea #12: Watch Party

### Description
**Problem:**
I would like a way to schedule a show program nightly and have it play on its own, in a group setting. There are limited resources to let this happen currently.

**Solution:** 
We propose a website dedicated to hosting these watch parties. It would store movies uploaded by users to play at designated times listed on the event. For now, we can limit rooms to small groups.

**Initial target customers:**
Small groups of friends

**Implementation:**
- The movies would be uploaded to the central database to be streamed starting at the proper time.
- Users will have options to create events on a schedule. These events can use a passcode, and can be deleted by the creating user.
- There may be a limit to the room size (i.e. how many can be on a website at once).
- Users will have the option to invite others to their schedule through a link. Others can join with an ID or anonymously.
- We need the ability to stream on a website.
- We need to store information via large video upload.
